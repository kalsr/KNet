        <div class="intro">
            <h2>About These Applications</h2>
            <p>
                KNet Programming Hub is a specialized innovation center developed by KNet Consulting Group, focused on building intelligent, secure, and future-ready digital solutions. Our hub brings together expertise in data science, artificial intelligence, cyber defense, and automation to design programs that simplify complex tasks and deliver actionable insights. At KNet, we have developed a diverse suite of applications ranging from autonomous data analysts, financial forecasters, anomaly detection systems, and visualization dashboards to cybersecurity threat monitoring, AI-powered agents, and workflow automation tools. Each program is carefully architected using modern toolkits such as Python, Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Docker, and Flask, ensuring reliability, scalability, and user-friendly design.

Our strength lies in leveraging Agentic-AI systems a new paradigm where multiple specialized agents (e.g., ingestors, cleaners, analyzers, anomaly detectors, segmenters, and modelers) collaborate autonomously to handle complex workflows. This agent-based architecture is especially valuable in cyber defense, where real-time monitoring, pattern recognition, and adaptive response are critical. By embedding Model Context Protocol (MCP), we enable seamless integration between AI models, external tools, and secure workflows, allowing our programs to reason, fetch context, and act with precision. MCP ensures interoperability and trust, while Agentic-AI adds autonomy and adaptability.

Through these technologies, KNet empowers organizations to defend digital assets, detect anomalies, forecast risks, and optimize decisions without requiring deep technical expertise from users. Every solution is designed to work as a digital co-pilot, automating repetitive tasks while keeping humans in control of strategy. The benefit to users is clear: faster insights, improved security posture, reduced manual errors, and a scalable framework that adapts to evolving business and cyber challenges. In short, KNet Programming Hub transforms raw data and complex systems into intelligent, secure, and easy-to-use solutions giving our clients the confidence to innovate safely in a digital-first world.

  <h2>Agentic-AI BASED AUTONOMOUS DATA ANALYST- Randy Singh</h2>
  <p>
    This Autonomous Data Analyst (Agentic-AI) Application is a Streamlit-based application designed to let users quickly explore, clean, and analyze datasets with minimal effort. It combines traditional Data Science Tools like Pandas (for data handling), NumPy (for numerical operations), Scikit-learn (for clustering and regression), SciPy (for anomaly detection), and Matplotlib library (for charts and visualizations) into a single, easy-to-use interface. The program works through a pipeline of specialized Agentic-AI components (or “agents”) that each perform a focused task: the Ingestor Agent loads datasets from CSV/JSON or generates synthetic data, the Cleaner Agent fixes missing values and removes duplicates, the Summarizer Agent provides statistical overviews, the Anomaly Detector Agent flags outliers using z-scores, the Segmentation Agent applies KMeans clustering to discover hidden groups, and the Modeling Agent builds a quick linear regression model to test predictive relationships. These agents are orchestrated in sequence, allowing users to run partial or full analysis with the click of a button. The system also provides interactive visual insights (pie charts, bar charts, line graphs) and allows exporting cleaned datasets and detailed reports. By automating routine analysis steps, this Agentic-AI approach empowers business users, analysts, and decision-makers to detect trends, spot risks, understand customer groups, and build simple predictive models without writing code. The benefit to users is Speed, Clarity, and Repeatability—Turning raw data into Actionable Insights in just a few clicks.

       <h2>Agentic Cyber Threat Hunting </h2>
      <p>
      The Agentic Cyber ML application is a web-based cybersecurity demo built with Streamlit, designed for threat detection, analysis, and visualization. It allows users to either
      generate synthetic network logs or upload real logs (CSV, JSON, Excel) containing timestamps, source/destination IPs, protocols, and byte counts. The program creates numeric features from these logs, such as encoded protocol and source-destination pair counts, and applies IsolationForest from scikit-learn for unsupervised anomaly detection. Logs are scored with an anomaly score and categorized as ALLOW, SUSPECT, or BLOCK, while Admin users can auto-quarantine top anomalous IPs. The app provides visualizations including anomaly histograms (via Plotly Express) and network graphs (via NetworkX and Plotly Graph Objects) to highlight traffic patterns and quarantined nodes. Users can download results in CSV, JSON, or Excel formats and maintain audit logs for tracking all actions.

The program is role-based: Admin can generate data, train models, score logs, perform auto-containment, reset the session, and view all audit logs; Analyst can generate data, train models, score logs, and upload files, but cannot auto-contain or reset; Viewer can only generate sample data, upload logs, and view results. This structured approach ensures security, accountability, and controlled access, while providing a user-friendly interface for proactive threat hunting, anomaly detection, and network monitoring.

            <h2>Agentic-AI Adaptive Incident Response Use-Case - Randy Singh</h2>
            <p>
                The Agentic Adaptive Incident Response Streamlit App is an AI-powered platform for managing cybersecurity events. 
                It allows users to generate or upload event data in CSV, JSON, or text formats. 
                The app visualizes incidents with pie charts, bar charts, and time-trend graphs using Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy. 
                Events are scored either heuristically or via optional ML models built with scikit-learn. 
                Users can simulate responses like host isolation, IP blocking, or sending SOC alerts. 
                Live actions can be executed via SSH (Paramiko) or cloud SDKs for AWS, GCP, and Azure. 
                Alerts can also be delivered through webhooks or SMTP email notifications. 
                A history log and runbook allow reviewing or replaying all actions. 
                The system supports scalable sample-data generation and dynamic dashboards. 
                Real-world benefits include faster, safer, and standardized incident response, improving SOC efficiency and operational resilience.
