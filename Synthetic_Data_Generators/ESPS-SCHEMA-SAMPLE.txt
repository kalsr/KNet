 ESPS (Enterprise Service Platform System) in the Department of Defense (DoD) refers to a 
 comprehensive data platform that integrates and manages various services, applications, and data across 
 the department. It aims to provide a unified infrastructure to streamline operations, improve data accessibility, 
 and enhance interoperability between different systems.

ESPS Data Sources

ESPS integrates multiple data sources to provide a holistic view of enterprise services, including:
1. Service Data: Information about the services provided, their descriptions, and statuses.
2. Application Data: Details of applications, their functionalities, and their integrations.
3. User Data: Information about the users and their roles within the system.
4. Operational Metrics: Performance and usage metrics for services and applications.
5. Compliance and Security: Data regarding compliance with regulations and security protocols.

ESPS Schema

A typical schema for an ESPS record might include the following fields:

1. Service Information
   - Service ID: Unique identifier for the service.
   - Service Name: Name of the service.
   - Service Description: Brief description of the service.
   - Service Type: Type of service (e.g., web service, microservice).
   - Service Owner: Organizational entity or individual responsible for the service.
   - Service Status: Current operational status of the service (e.g., active, inactive, deprecated).

2. Application Information
   - Application ID: Unique identifier for the application.
   - Application Name: Name of the application.
   - Application Description: Brief description of the application's purpose.
   - Application Version: Current version of the application.
   - Application Status: Current operational status of the application (e.g., active, inactive, deprecated).

3. User Information
   - User ID: Unique identifier for the user.
   - User Name: Name of the user.
   - User Role: Role of the user within the system.
   - User Contact Information: Contact details for the user.

4. Operational Metrics
   - Metric ID: Unique identifier for the operational metric.
   - Metric Description: Description of the metric.
   - Metric Value: Value of the metric.
   - Measurement Date: Date when the metric was measured.

5. Compliance and Security
   - Compliance ID: Unique identifier for the compliance record.
   - Regulation: Specific regulation or standard being referenced.
   - Compliance Status: Status of compliance (e.g., compliant, non-compliant).
   - Security Classification: Security classification level of the service/application (e.g., unclassified, confidential, secret).
   - Risk Assessment: Details about identified risks and mitigation strategies.

 API Information

If ESPS tracks APIs, the schema would include fields to capture API-related data, such as:

6. API Information
   - API Name: The name of the API.
   - API Description: A brief description of what the API does.
   - API Version: The current version of the API.
   - API Endpoints: List of endpoints provided by the API.
   - API Documentation: Links or references to the API documentation.
   - API Protocols: The protocols used by the API (e.g., REST, SOAP, GraphQL).
   - Authentication Methods: The methods used to authenticate API requests (e.g., API key, OAuth).
   - Rate Limits: Information about any rate limits applied to the API.
   - Usage Metrics: Data on how often the API is called and by whom.
   - API POC (Point of Contact): Name and contact information for the primary contact person for the API.
