

 MAPS(Modernized Acquisition and Procurement System) is a data repository used by the Department of Defense (DoD) 
 to manage and streamline acquisition and procurement processes. It integrates various data sources to provide 
 comprehensive tracking and management of procurement activities, ensuring efficiency, compliance, 
 and transparency in defense acquisitions.

 MAPS Data Sources

MAPS pulls data from several key sources, including:
1. Contract Data: Information about contracts, including terms, conditions, and financial details.
2. Vendor Data: Information about vendors, their qualifications, and performance history.
3. Acquisition Plans: Detailed plans and strategies for procurement activities.
4. Budget Information: Data on budget allocations and expenditures.
5. Compliance Records: Documentation of compliance with federal and DoD procurement regulations.
6. Performance Metrics: Data on the performance of contractors and procurement processes.

MAPS Schema

A typical schema for a MAPS record might include the following fields:

1. Contract Information
   - Contract ID: Unique identifier for the contract.
   - Contract Name: Name of the contract.
   - Contract Description: Brief description of the contract's scope and objectives.
   - Contract Type: Type of contract (e.g., fixed-price, cost-reimbursement).
   - Contract Value: Total value of the contract.
   - Award Date: Date when the contract was awarded.
   - Expiration Date: Date when the contract is set to expire.
   - Contract Status: Current status of the contract (e.g., active, completed, terminated).

2. Vendor Information
   - Vendor ID: Unique identifier for the vendor.
   - Vendor Name: Name of the vendor.
   - Vendor Address: Contact address of the vendor.
   - Vendor Contact Information: Contact details for the vendor.
   - Vendor Performance History: Performance records of the vendor in previous contracts.

3. Acquisition Plan
   - Plan ID: Unique identifier for the acquisition plan.
   - Plan Name: Name of the acquisition plan.
   - Plan Description: Description of the acquisition strategy.
   - Plan Approval Date: Date when the acquisition plan was approved.
   - Responsible Officer: Name and contact information of the officer responsible for the plan.

4. Budget Information
   - Budget ID: Unique identifier for the budget record.
   - Budget Amount: Total budget allocated.
   - Budget Source: Source of the budget funds.
   - Budget Utilization: Details on how the budget is being utilized.

5. Compliance Records
   - Compliance ID: Unique identifier for the compliance record.
   - Regulation: Specific regulation or standard being referenced.
   - Compliance Status: Status of compliance (e.g., compliant, non-compliant).
   - Compliance Date: Date of the compliance check.

6. Performance Metrics
   - Metric ID: Unique identifier for the performance metric.
   - Metric Description: Description of the performance metric.
   - Performance Data: Data points related to the performance of the contract or vendor.
   - Evaluation Date: Date of the performance evaluation.

API Tracking

MAPS could track APIs if it includes them as part of its procurement and acquisition management functions. For example, if the procurement involves software or systems that utilize APIs, the following fields could be added to the schema:

7. API Information
   - API Name: The name of the API.
   - API Description: A brief description of what the API does.
   - API Version: The current version of the API.
   - API Endpoints: List of endpoints provided by the API.
   - API Documentation: Links or references to the API documentation.
   - API Protocols: The protocols used by the API (e.g., REST, SOAP, GraphQL).
   - Authentication Methods: The methods used to authenticate API requests (e.g., API key, OAuth).
   - Rate Limits: Information about any rate limits applied to the API.
   - Usage Metrics: Data on how often the API is called and by whom.
   - API POC (Point of Contact): Name and contact information for the primary contact person for the API.
